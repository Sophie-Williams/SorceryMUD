# SorceryMUD, a MUD game created to demonstrate the potential of MUDBot

In order to run the SorceryMUD server, you will need to install ZeroMQ. If you want to compile SorceryMUD, you will also need to download the C++ binding.

You can get ZeroMQ at http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software, and you can get the C++ binding at https://github.com/zeromq/cppmzq/.
